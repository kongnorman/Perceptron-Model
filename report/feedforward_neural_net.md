This is the beginning of my report.

An introduction to the topic of choice and statement of your research question:

We are at a time where our collections of data are increasing to levels never before seen in history. It is estimated that more than 90 percent of the data we store today was generated within only the last 10 years or so. As recently as a few years ago, the majority of this data was virtually useless as traditional analytical methods are not fast enough to process these huge collections of information within reasonable amounts of time. Thus, the way in which we dealt with data required change. (Foreword, PML nook).

Question:
How does the number of neurons within the hidden layer of a sigmoid feedforward neural network affect the accuracy of the prediction?
